# Content Folders #

Every page and it's contents should be placed inside a different directory. In this case, one of our pages is
called `home`. All the `home` page related files are placed inside the directory called _home_. For example,
if the `home` page contained multiple tabs, it can contain multiple templates and controllers for each of
those tabs. Transition between those tabs are controlled by the router configuration inside this folder.
